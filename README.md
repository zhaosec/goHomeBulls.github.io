##MVP

It is the game application run in PC which is based on javascript. 
Our final destination of this game is to put drunken bulls to thier cages.
We can move left, right, up, down and push the bulls in complicated maps.
Each stages of map will be based on UB campus including North and South. 
There will be a few traps like lake if bulls fall into the traps the game will be ended.
We will add stamina system.
Have you pushed drunken bulls?
That will be super extremely tough job. So stamina will be decreased each of steps(push).
If stamina become zero, the game will be finished automatically
Stamina drinks will show up randomly in each stages.
Therefore, maintaining stamina is the key.
